**What it does**

The purpose of this program is to identify single nucleotide positions that are different between tumor and normal
(or, in theory, any two bam files). It takes a tumor bam and a normal bam and compares the two to determine the
differences. It outputs a file in a format very similar to Samtools consensus format. It uses the genotype likelihood
model of MAQ (as implemented in Samtools) and then calculates the probability that the tumor and normal genotypes are
different. This probability is reported as a somatic score. The somatic score is the Phred-scaled probability (between 0 to 255)
that the Tumor and Normal genotypes are not different where 0 means there is no probability that the genotypes are different and
255 means there is a probability of 1 â€“ 10(255/-10) that the genotypes are different between tumor and normal. This is consistent
with how the SAM format reports such probabilities.

Bam files must contain LB tag in @RG line.
Picard tools can be used to add lines to BAM headers.
